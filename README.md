A survey is a research method used for collecting data from a predefined group of respondents to gain information and insights into various topics of interest. They can have multiple purposes, and researchers can conduct it in many ways depending on the methodology chosen and the study’s goal
This project proposes a "survey poll" to keep track of the people’s choices and thinking and contains information in the database about the certain issue or trending news. 

Functionality : 
The website has a very simple and interactive user interface that helps users to see the trending polls and surveys and how people from certain location think regarding an issue .

Application Features:
Using bootstrap framework along with basic HTML and CSS of the well-known target market with recommendations and interactive buttons makes it easy for users to sign-in or sign-out with the application.

Backend:

Data is updated in the website and users can see it and follow accordingly.
